    <h2>A brief summary of his life as an artist</h2>
    <h3>early life</h3>
    <p><b>Fela Aníkúlápó Kuti</b> <i>(born Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti; 15 October 1938, 2 August 1997)</i> , also known as <strong>Abami Eda</strong>, was a <i>Nigerian musician</i>, bandleader, composer, political activist, and Pan-Africanist. <b>He is regarded as the pioneer of Afrobeat</b>, a Nigerian music genre that combines West African music with American funk and jazz.[2] At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of Africa's most "challenging and charismatic music performers".[3] AllMusic described him as "a musical and sociopolitical voice" of international significance.Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti[6] was born into the Ransome-Kuti family, an upper-middle-class Nigerian family, on 15 October 1938 in Abeokuta (the modern-day capital of Ogun State[7]), which at the time was a city in the British Colony of Nigeria.[8] His mother, Chief Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti, was an anti-colonial feminist, and his father, Reverend Israel Oludotun Ransome-Kuti, was an Anglican minister, school principal, and the first president of the Nigeria Union of Teachers.</p>
    <h3>His music</h3>
    <p>Kuti's musical style is called[44] <b>Afrobeat</b>. It is a style he largely created, and is a complex fusion of jazz, funk, highlife, and traditional Nigerian, African chants and rhythms. It contains elements of psychedelic soul and has similarities to James Brown's music. Afrobeat also borrows heavily from the native "tinker pan".[45] Tony Allen, Kuti's drummer of twenty years, was instrumental in the creation of Afrobeat. Kuti once stated that "there would be no Afrobeat without Tony Allen".[46]</p>
    <h3>Showmanship</h3>
    <p>Kuti was known for his <strong>showmanship</strong>, and his concerts were often outlandish and wild. He referred to his stage act as the "Underground Spiritual Game". Many expected him to perform shows like those in the Western world, but during the 1980s, he was not interested in putting on a "show". His European performance was a representation of what was relevant at the time and his other inspirations.[3] He attempted to make a movie but lost all the materials to the fire that was set to his house by the military government in power.[48] He thought that art, and thus his own music, should have political meaning.</p>
